 Each year, the U.S. healthcare system suffers from over $500B in wasted spending due to medical billing fraud, waste, and administrative burden. At Alaffia, we’re on a mission to change that. We’ve assembled a team of clinicians, AI/ML engineers, and product experts to build advanced AI that finally bends the cost curve for all patients across our ecosystem. We’re a high\-growth, venture\-backed startup based in NYC and are actively scaling our company.
 



  





**Our Culture** 




 At Alaffia, we fundamentally believe that the whole is more valuable than the sum of its individual parts. Further to that point, we believe a diverse team of individuals with various backgrounds, ideologies, and types of training generates the most value. Our people are entrepreneurial by nature, problem solvers, and are passionate about what they do — both inside and outside of the office.
 



  





**About the Role \& What You’ll Be Doing** 




 We're looking for a dynamic Operations Analyst to join our growing healthtech startup and play a pivotal role in scaling our operations as we expand. This isn't your typical Ops Analyst position \- you'll be building the operational foundation that will support our next phase of growth while directly impacting how we deliver value to healthcare clients.
 



  





 In this role, you'll wear multiple hats and own critical processes that keep our business running smoothly. One day you might be designing a new workflow to streamline client onboarding, the next you could be diving into data to identify why certain claims are taking longer to process, and later that week you might be presenting operational improvements to our leadership team. You'll work closely with our product, client success, and technical teams, serving as the operational backbone that connects our technology solutions to real\-world healthcare outcomes.
 



  





 The ideal candidate thrives in fast\-paced, evolving environments where no two days look the same. You'll have the autonomy to identify problems, design solutions, and implement changes that directly impact our clients and bottom line.
 



  





**Your Responsibilities** 



* Design, implement, and continuously refine operational processes and SOPs across business functions, adapting quickly as the company scales
* Own end\-to\-end reporting workflows \- from data collection and analysis to client delivery, troubleshooting issues independently when they arise
* Manage complex, multi\-step client documentation workflows while juggling competing priorities and tight deadlines
* Proactively identify process bottlenecks and inefficiencies, then lead cross\-functional initiatives to resolve them
* Serve as a key liaison between operations, product, and client success teams, translating business needs into actionable process improvements
* Build and maintain scalable documentation systems and training materials that can grow with our expanding team
* Conduct data\-driven operational audits and present findings with concrete recommendations to leadership
* Support appeal management processes for managed services clients, including documentation, accessing customer electronic systems to obtain claim information
* Stay ahead of industry trends in healthtech operations and payment integrity, bringing innovative solutions to enhance our competitive advantage



  





**What We're Looking For** 



* Bachelor's degree or demonstrated experience in related field
* 4\-5\+ years of hands\-on experience in fast\-paced, smaller organizations (startups, scale\-ups, preferably in the healthcare space)
* Exceptional multitasking abilities with experience managing concurrent projects without dropping details
* Self\-starter mentality \- you identify problems and proactively target solutions
* Analytical and problem\-solving skills with experience using data to drive operational decisions
* Proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets, plus comfort learning new software platforms
* Healthcare operations or payment integrity experience is a plus, but we value adaptability over domain expertise
* Excellent communication skills with experience presenting to leadership and managing client relationships
* Comfortable with ambiguity and excited about the opportunity to shape processes and systems in a growing company
* Ability to work independently while knowing when to collaborate and escalate appropriately



  





**What Else Do You Get Working With Us?** 



* Access to Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits

UNDP is the United Nations' global sustainable development organization working across 170 countries with 17,000 staff.
   

  

 Digital technology is one of the most fundamental drivers of change this century. Digital not only provides new opportunities and challenges for development, but it is also fundamentally changing the context in which development is taking place. Since the launch of its first Digital Strategy in 2019, UNDP has been on an ambitious transformation journey to harness the potential of digital technology for development. We are now in the next phase of our digital transformation, implementing the Digital Strategy 2022\-2025, which puts forth a vision to create a world in which digital is an empowering force for people and planet.

 The Local Language Accelerator Programme focuses on accelerating inclusive access to and local use of data in low\-resourced languages to ensure digital products are available in local languages, natively spoken by more than 3 billion people.

**About The Role**
 We’re a telehealth company helping people lose weight at scale. This role is a force\-multiplier for the org: a smart generalist who can turn ambiguous questions into clear plans, run lightweight experiments, and drive decisions across marketing, product, and ops. You’ll pick the right tool for each job, build simple artifacts that others can run with, and keep projects moving to done.
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Tool \& Vendor Evaluation: Compare options (e.g., influencer CRMs, analytics/MMPs), score trade\-offs, run pilots, and recommend a path with clear success criteria and costs.

* Experimentation \& Documentation: Partner with Eng/Data to scope tests, define metrics/guardrails, coordinate rollout, and publish tight experiment memos.

* Project Management: Create simple plans, owners, and timelines; follow up across teams; unblock decisions; report progress.


 Who You Are
   

  

* 1\-3 years in a generalist role (strategy \& ops, biz ops, growth, product ops, or analytics). Startup or fast\-moving environment preferred.
* Strong problem\-framer: you turn vague asks into hypotheses, plans, and measurable outcomes.
* Comfortable with data: SQL for pulls and basic analysis; some Python to maintain code and debug when necessary.
* Working knowledge of product \+ marketing analytics concepts (events, funnels, attribution, cohorts, A/B tests).
* Clear, concise writer who publishes decision memos and dashboards people actually use.
* Organized, persistent, and low\-ego. You close loops.


 What Success Looks Like (First 30 Days)
   

  

* One vendor decision delivered end\-to\-end with a short pilot and a clear roll\-out plan.
* A standard user\-flow dashboard that at least two teams adopt for weekly reviews.
* One policy proposal (e.g., refunds) with revenue/CS impact and edge\-case handling.
* One or Two experiments run with published results and next\-step decisions.
* A lightweight operating cadence: owners, timelines, and status updates across 3–5 workstreams.


 Nice to Have
   

  

* Experience with influencer/creator operations or marketplace/telehealth contexts.
* Familiarity with BI/analytics tools and simple automation (APIs, scripts, or no\-code).
* Comfort modeling costs/ROI and communicating trade\-offs to non\-technical stakeholders.

This includes enabling activation workflows by integrating with Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) and reverse ETL tools, ensuring data can flow back into the business applications where it drives customer engagement and business value.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
 Data Modeling \& Transformation
   

  

* Design and implement robust data models that capture business processes in a way that is both technically efficient and intuitive to support both operational and analytical applications.
* Architect transformations that take raw ingested data and organize it into normalized, curated, and dimensional structures (fact and dimension tables, incremental models, semantic layers).
* Continuously optimize queries and transformations to balance performance, cost efficiency, and usability at scale.
* Implement development workflows using tools like dbt, ensuring best practices in maintainable, version\-controlled transformations.
* Assist in building semantic layers or standardized data marts that enable consistent reporting across different BI and analytics platforms.


 Dimensional Modeling \& Warehouse Design
   

  

* Apply well\-established modeling methodologies (e.g., Kimball, Inmon, or hybrid approaches) to create fact and dimension tables that are intuitive to explore and flexible for a variety of BI and operational use cases.
* Design data structures that account for real\-world complexity, such as slowly changing dimensions, surrogate keys, and evolving hierarchies.
* Optimize warehouse schemas to maximize performance of common queries and dashboards while maintaining scalability as data volumes and complexity grow.
* Provide guidance on how analysts and BI engineers should access curated data to maximize usability and efficiency.


 Data Cleaning, Enrichment, \& Quality Assurance
   

  

* Standardize raw input data from multiple ingestion pipelines, resolving schema inconsistencies, handling null values, normalizing dimensions, and reconciling discrepancies across systems.
* Enhance raw data through enrichment pipelines (e.g., mapping IDs, joining reference data, and appending third\-party sources) to ensure that business teams work with richer, more contextually useful datasets.
* Build a systematic approach to data quality monitoring within the warehouse, integrating checks for completeness, freshness, anomalies, duplicates, and referential integrity.
* Proactively surface quality issues to upstream data engineers or source system owners and drive resolution workflows to maintain trust in the platform.


 Testing, Documentation, \& Governance
   

  

* Implement automated data testing frameworks to validate assumptions and prevent issues from reaching production (e.g., uniqueness constraints, non\-null checks, schema integrity, reference checks).
* Integrate testing and validation into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows, ensuring that all code changes are reviewed and tested before release.
* Document data models, transformations, lineage, and business logic in both internal wikis/tools and self\-serve documentation systems like dbt Docs.
* Actively contribute to establishing and enforcing governance standards around naming conventions, folder structures, code review practices, and data definitions.


 Cross\-Functional Collaboration \& Enablement
   

  

* Work closely with Data Engineers to align on pipeline designs, ensuring ingestion delivers the raw elements needed to build reliable transformations.
* Partner with BI Engineers and business analysts to understand their reporting needs, proactively building curated datasets that shorten the path to insight.
* Act as a domain expert for business metrics, advising stakeholders on how to use available datasets responsibly and helping them understand trade\-offs in metric design.
* Contribute to building a culture of data literacy by creating self\-service data products that empower stakeholders to explore and analyze data with minimal technical barriers.


**Requirements**
* Strong proficiency in SQL and experience with ELT transformation tools (e.g., dbt).
* Deep understanding of dimensional modeling and warehouse design principles.
* Experience with modern cloud data platforms (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery).
* Familiarity with business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI) and their data integration patterns.
* Exposure to Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) and/or Reverse ETL workflows, with an understanding of how curated warehouse data can be activated in marketing, sales, or customer engagement platforms.
* Knowledge of testing frameworks, Git\-based workflows, and CI/CD for analytics.
* Strong communication skills for bridging technical and business audiences.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Hands\-on experience with data orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect).
* Familiarity with Reverse ETL tools (Hightouch, Census) or CDPs (Segment, RudderStack, mParticle, Amperity).
